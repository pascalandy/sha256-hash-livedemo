## What is it?

(This text is extracted from the audio above with a AI software.) 

Hey everyone Pascal Andy here.

So today I'm sharing this ash demo, which shows what the heck do miners mine on the shot to 56 algorithm.

This is part of crypto in Montreal. So this is how to run this demo, you need to have Docker on your local machine so personally I use a Macintosh and then you go within the ash demo directory and then you actually run the run up that sh script and then you are in the terminal and then if you do an ls you will see all the demos x one as an example. 

So you can run x one x two x three x for those four examples are just showing what is and Sha 256 function. It just shows the function and then the demo example 5678 this show.

What the heck do miners mine. So of course, um, it's very cool to have the real demo before doing this example on GitHub. So I guess if you're listening to this. It's because you already saw my demo earlier.

Have fun. Cheers. Bye bye.
