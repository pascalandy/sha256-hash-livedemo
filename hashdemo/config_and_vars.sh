#!/usr/bin/env bash

# A best practices Bash script template with many useful functions. This file
# sources in the bulk of the functions from the source.sh file which it expects
# to be in the same directory. Only those functions which are likely to need
# modification are present in this file. This is a great combination if you're
# writing several scripts! By pulling in the common functions you'll minimise
# code duplication, as well as ease any potential updates to shared functions.

# A better class of script
set -o errexit          # Exit on most errors (see the manual)
set -o errtrace         # Make sure any error trap is inherited
set -o nounset          # Disallow expansion of unset variables
set -o pipefail         # Use last non-zero exit code in a pipeline
#set -o xtrace          # Trace the execution of the script (debug)

# Define variables for the whole project
# USE CAPITAL VARS to indicate this VAR comes from outside
